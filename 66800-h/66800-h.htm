</div>
<p class="ph3">BY RICHARD JEFFERIES, AUTHOR OF THE ‘GAMEKEEPER
AT HOME,’ ETC.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> birds of spring come as imperceptibly as the
leaves. One by one the buds open on hawthorn
and willow, till all at once the hedges appear
green, and so the birds steal quietly into the
bushes and trees, till by-and-by a chorus fills the
wood, and each warm shower is welcomed with
varied song. To many, the majority of spring-birds
are really unknown; the cuckoo, the nightingale,
and the swallow, are all with which they
are acquainted, and these three make the summer.
The loud cuckoo cannot be overlooked by any
one passing even a short time in the fields; the
nightingale is so familiar in verse that every one
tries to hear it; and the swallows enter the towns
and twitter at the chimney-top. But these are
really only the principal representatives of the
crowd of birds that flock to our hedges in the
early summer; and perhaps it would be accurate
to say that no other area of equal extent, either
in Europe or elsewhere, receives so many feathered
visitors. The English climate is the established
subject of abuse, yet it is the climate most preferred
and sought by the birds, who have the
choice of immense continents.</p>

<p>Nothing that I have ever read of, or seen, or that
I expect to see, equals the beauty and the delight
of a summer spent in our woods and meadows.
Green leaves and grass, and sunshine, blue skies,
and sweet brooks&mdash;there is nothing to approach
it; it is no wonder the birds are tempted to us.
The food they find is so abundant, that after all
their efforts, little apparent diminution can be
noticed; to this fertile and lovely country, therefore,
they hasten every year. It might be said
that the spring-birds begin to come to us in the
autumn, as early as October, when hedge-sparrows
and golden-crested wrens, larks, blackbirds, and
thrushes, and many others, float over on the gales
from the coasts of Norway. Their numbers,
especially of the smaller birds, such as larks, are
immense, and their line of flight so extended that
it strikes our shores for a distance of two hundred
miles. The vastness of these numbers, indeed,
makes me question whether they all come from
Scandinavia. That is their route; Norway seems
to be the last land they see before crossing; but
I think it possible that their original homes may
have been farther still. Though many go back in
the spring, many individuals remain here, and
rejoice in the plenty of the hedgerows. As all
roads of old time led to Rome, so do bird-routes
lead to these islands. Some of these birds appear
to pair in November, and so have settled their
courtship long before the crocuses of St Valentine.
Much difference is apparent in the dates recorded
of the arrivals in spring; they vary year by year,
and now one and now another bird presents itself
first, so that I shall not in these notes attempt to
arrange them in strict order.</p>

<p>One of the first noticeable in southern fields
is the common wagtail. When his shrill note
is heard echoing against the walls of the outhouses
as he rises from the ground, the carters and ploughmen
know that there will not be much more frost.
If icicles hang from the thatched eaves, they will
not long hang, but melt before the softer wind.
The bitter part of winter is over. The wagtail is
a house-bird, making the houses or cattle-pens
its centre, and remaining about them for months.
There is not a farmhouse in the south of England
without its summer pair of wagtails, not more
than one pair as a rule, for they are not gregarious
till winter; but considering that every
farmhouse has its pair, their numbers must be
really large.</p>

<p>Where wheatears frequent, their return is very
marked; they appear suddenly in the gardens
and open places, and cannot be overlooked.
Swallows return one by one at first, and we
get used to them by degrees. The wheatears
seem to drop out of the night, and to be showered
down on the ground in the morning. A white
bar on the tail renders them conspicuous, for
at that time much of the surface of the earth
is bare and dark. Naturally birds of the wildest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">{130}</span>
and most open country, they yet show no dread,
but approach the houses closely. They are local
in their habits, or perhaps follow a broad but
well-defined route of migration; so that while
common in one place, they are rare in others.
In two localities with which I am familiar, and
know every path, I never saw a wheatear. I
heard of them occasionally as passing over, but
they were not birds of the district. In Sussex,
on the contrary, the wheatear is as regularly seen
as the blackbird; and in the spring and summer
you cannot go a walk without finding them.
They change their ground three times: first on
arrival, they feed in the gardens and arable fields;
next, they go up on the hills; lastly, they return
to the coast, and frequent the extreme edge of
the cliffs and the land by the shore. Every bird
has its different manner; I do not know how else
to express it. Now, the wheatears move in numbers,
and yet not in concert; in spring, perhaps
twenty may be counted in sight at once on the
ground, feeding together and yet quite separate;
just opposite in manner to starlings, who feed
side by side and rise and fly as one. Every
wheatear feeds by himself, a space between him
and his neighbour, dotted about, and yet they
obviously have a certain amount of mutual understanding;
they recognise that they belong to the
same family, but maintain their individuality.
On the hills in their breeding season they act
in the same way; each pair has a wide piece of
turf, sometimes many acres. But if you see one
pair, it is certain that other pairs are in the
neighbourhood. In their breeding-grounds they
will not permit a man to approach so near as
when they arrive, or as when the nesting is over.
At the time of their arrival, any one can walk
up within a short distance; so again in autumn.
During the nesting-time the wheatear perches on a
molehill, or a large flint, or any slight elevation
above the open surface of the downs, and allows
no one to come closer than fifty yards.</p>

<p>The hedge-sparrows, that creep about the bushes
of the hedgerow as mice creep about the banks,
are early in spring joined by the whitethroats,
almost the first hedgebirds to return. The thicker
the undergrowth of nettles and wild parsley,
rushes and rough grasses, the more the whitethroat
likes the spot. Amongst this tangled
mass he lives and feeds, slipping about under the
brambles and ferns as rapidly as if the way was
clear. Loudest of all, the chiff-chaff sings in the
ash woods, bare and leafless, while yet the sharp
winds rush between the poles, rattling them
together, and bringing down the dead twigs to
the earth. The violets are difficult to find, few
and scattered; but his clear note rings in the
hushes of the eastern breeze, encouraging the
flowers. It is very pleasant indeed to hear him;
one’s hands are dry and the skin rough with the
east wind; the trunks of the trees look dry, and
the lichens have shrivelled on the bark; the brook
looks dark; gray dust rises and drifts, and the
gray clouds hurry over; but the chiff-chaff sings,
and it is certainly spring. The first green leaves
which the elder put forth in January have been
burned up by frost, and the woodbine, which
looked as if it would soon be entirely green then,
has been checked, and remains a promise only.
The chiff-chaff tells the buds of the coming April
rains and the sweet soft intervals of warm sun.
He is a sure forerunner. He defies the bitter
wind; his little heart is as true as steel. He is
one of the birds in which I feel a personal interest,
as if I could converse with him. The willow-wren,
his friend, comes later, and has a gentler,
plaintive song.</p>

<p>Meadow-pipits are not migrants in the sense
that the swallows are; but they move about and
so change their localities, that when they come
back they have much of the interest of a spring-bird.
They rise from the ground and sing in the
air like larks, but not at such a height, nor is
the song so beautiful. These, too, are early birds.
They often frequent very exposed places, as the
side of a hill where the air is keen, and where
one would not expect to meet with so lively a
little creature. The pond has not yet any of
the growths that will presently render its margin
green; the willow-herbs are still low, the aquatic
grasses have not become strong, and the osiers are
without leaf. If examined closely, evidences of
growth would be found everywhere around it;
but as yet the surface is open, and it looks cold.
Along the brook the shoals are visible, as the flags
have not risen from the stems which were cut
down in the autumn. In the sedges, however,
the first young shoots are thrusting up, and the
reeds have started, slender green stalks tipped
with the first leaves. At the verge of the water,
a thick green plant of marsh-marigold has one
or two great golden flowers open. This is the
appearance of his home when the sedge-reedling
returns to it. Sometimes he may be seen flitting
across the pond, or perched for a moment on an
exposed branch; but he quickly returns to the
dry sedges or the bushes, or climbs in and out
the willow-stoles. It is too bare and open for
him at the pond, or even by the brook-side. So
much does he love concealment, that although to
be near the water is his habit, for a while he
prefers to keep back among the bushes. As the
reeds and reed canary-grass come up and form
a cover&mdash;as the sedges grow green and advance to
the edge of the water&mdash;as the sword-flags lift up
and expand, opening from a centre, the sedge-reedling
issues from the bushes and enters these
vigorous growths, on which he perches, and about
which he climbs as if they were trees. In the
pleasant mornings, when the sun grows warm
about eleven o’clock, he calls and sings with
scarcely a cessation, and is answered by his companions
up and down the stream. He does but
just interrupt his search for food to sing; he stays
a moment, calls, and immediately resumes his
prying into every crevice of the branches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">{131}</span>
stoles. The thrush often sits on a bough and
sings for a length of time, apart from his food,
and without thinking of it, absorbed in his song,
and full of the sweetness of the day. These
restless sedge-reedlings cannot pause; their little
feet are for ever at work, climbing about the
willow-stoles where the wands spring from the
trunk; they never reflect, they are always engaged.
This restlessness is to them a great pleasure; they
are filled with the life which the sun gives, and
express it in every motion; they are so joyful,
they cannot be still. Step into the osier bed
amongst them gently; they will chirp&mdash;a note
like a sparrow’s&mdash;just in front, and only recede
a yard at a time, as you push through the tall
grass, flags, and underwood. Stand where you
can see the brook, not too near, but so as to see
it through a fringe of sedges and willows. The
pink lychnis or ragged robin grows among the
grasses; the iris flowers higher on the shore.
The water-vole comes swimming past on his way
to nibble the green weeds in the stream round
about the great branch which fell two winters
since and remains in the water. Aquatic plants
take root in its shelter. There, too, a moorhen
goes, sometimes diving under the bough. A
blackbird flies up to drink or bathe, never at the
grassy edge, but always choosing a spot where he
can get at the stream free from obstruction. The
sound of many birds singing comes from the
hedge across the meadow; it mingles with the
rush of the water through a drawn hatch&mdash;finches
and linnets, thrush and chiff-chaff, wren
and whitethroat, and others farther away, whose
louder notes only, reach. The singing is so mixed
and interwoven, and is made of so many notes, it
seems as if it were the leaves singing, the countless
leaves, as if they had voices.</p>

<p>A brightly coloured bird, the redstart, appears
suddenly in spring, like a flower that has bloomed
before the bud was noticed. Red is his chief
colour, and as he rushes out from his perch to
take an insect on the wing, he looks like a red
streak. These birds sometimes nest near farmhouses
in the rickyards, sometimes by copses,
and sometimes in the deepest and most secluded
coombes or glens, the farthest places from habitation;
so that they cannot be said to have any
preference, as so many birds have, for a particular
kind of locality; but they return year by year
to the places they have chosen. The return of
the corncrake or landrail is quickly recognised by
the noise he makes in the grass; he is the noisiest
of all the spring-birds. The return of the goatsucker
is hardly noticed at first. This is not at
all a rare, but rather a local bird, well known in
many places, but in others unnoticed, except by
those who feel a special interest. A bird must
be common and plentiful before people generally
observe it, so that there are many of the
labouring class who have never seen the goatsucker,
or would say so, if you asked them. Few
observe the migration of the turtle-doves, perhaps
confusing them with the wood-pigeons, which
stay in the fields all the winter. By the time
the sap is well up in the oaks, all the birds have
arrived, and the tremulous cooing of the turtle-dove
is heard by those engaged in barking the felled
trees. The sap rises slowly in the oaks, moving
gradually through the minute interstices or
capillary tubes of this close-grained wood; the
softer timber trees are full of it long before the
oak; and when the oak is putting forth its leaves,
it is high spring. Doves stay so much at this time
in the great hawthorns of the hedgerows and at
the edge of the copses, that they are seldom
noticed, though comparatively large birds. They
are easily seen by any who wish; the coo-coo tells
where they are; and in walking gently to find
them, many other lesser birds will be observed.
A wryneck may be caught sight of on a bough
overhead; a black-headed bunting, in the hedge
where there is a wet ditch and rushes; a blackcap,
in the birches; and the ‘zee-zee-zee’ of the
tree-pipit by the oaks just through the narrow
copse.</p>

<p>This is the most pleasant and the best way to
observe&mdash;to have an object, when so many things
will be seen that would have been passed unnoticed.
To steal softly along the hedgerow, keeping out
of sight as much as possible, pausing now and
then to listen as the coo-coo is approached; and
then, when near enough to see the doves, to remain
quiet behind a tree, is the surest way to see
everything else. The thrush will not move from
her nest if passed so quietly; the chaffinch’s
lichen-made nest will be caught sight of against
the elm-trunk&mdash;it would escape notice otherwise;
the whitethroat may be watched in the nettles
almost underneath; a rabbit will sit on his
haunches and look at you from among the bare
green stalks of brake rising; mice will rustle
under the ground-ivy’s purple flowers; a mole
perhaps may be seen, for at this time they often
leave their burrows and run along the surface;
and indeed so numerous are the sights and sounds
and interesting things, that you will soon be
conscious of the fact, that while you watch one,
two or three more are escaping you. It would
be the same with any other search as well as the
dove; I choose the dove because by then all the
other creatures are come and are busy, and because
it is a fairly large bird with a distinctive note,
and consequently a good guide.</p>

<p>But these are not all the spring-birds: there
are the whinchats, fly-catchers, sandpipers, ring-ousels,
and others that are occasional or rare.
There is not a corner of the fields, woods, streams,
or hills, which does not receive a new inhabitant;
the sandpiper comes to the open sandy margins
of the pool; the fly-catcher, to the old post by the
garden; the whinchat, to the furze; the tree-pipit,
to the oaks, where their boughs overhang meadow
or cornfield; the sedge-reedling, to the osiers; the
dove, to the thick hedgerows; the wheatear, to the
hills; and I see I have overlooked the butcher-bird
or shrike, as indeed in writing of these things
one is certain to overlook something, so wide is
the subject. Many of the spring-birds do not
sing on their first arrival, but stay a little while;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">{132}</span>
by that time, others are here. Grass blade comes
up by grass blade till the meadows are freshly
green; leaf comes forth by leaf till the trees are
covered; and like the leaves, the birds gently
take their places, till the hedges are imperceptibly
filled.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;IN HARVEST-TIME.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the harvest-work on the lands of
Ringsford Manor was progressing rapidly&mdash;to the
surprise of the neighbours, who had heard that
Mr Hadleigh could not obtain hands, owing to
his craze about the beer question. He did not
obtain much sympathy in the district in this
attempted social revolution. It was known that
he was not a teetotaler himself; and most of the
proprietors and farmers and all the labourers
took Caleb Kersey’s view, that apart from the
question whether beer was good or bad for them,
this autocratic refusal of it to those who preferred
to have it was an interference with the liberty
of the subject. As he passed through the market-place,
a band of labourers had shouted in chorus
the old rhyme: ‘Darn his eyes, whoever tries,
to rob a poor man of his beer.’</p>

<p>But in spite of this determined opposition, here
was a strong troop of men and women clearing
the ground so fast that it looked as if the Ringsford
cutting and ingathering would be completed
as soon as that of any other farm. And the beer
was not allowed on the field.</p>

<p>This was wonderful: but a greater wonder still
was the fact that the hands who had been so
swiftly brought together were working under
Caleb Kersey himself&mdash;Caleb, the peasants’
champion, the temperance defender of every man’s
right to get drunk if he liked! There were
mutterings of discontent amongst his followers:
there were whispers that he had been heavily
bribed to desert their cause; and those who had
previously deserted him, shook their heavy heads,
declaring that they ‘knowed what was a-coming.’</p>

<p>‘It ain’t fair on him&mdash;he ain’t acting square
by me,’ Jacob Cone, the Ringsford bailiff, had
been heard to say in the <i>Cherry Tree</i> taproom.
‘He comes and he takes my place, and does whatever
master wants, when I was a-trying to get
master to let folk have their own way, as they’ve
been allays ’customed to.’</p>

<p>That was Jacob’s first and last grumble; for
Caleb, hearing of it, took him to every one of
the hands, and each made the same statement:</p>

<p>‘We can do without the beer. We gave it up
because we choose to, and not because we’re
forced to.’</p>

<p>For the rest, Caleb contented himself with
saying simply: ‘I ain’t working for Mr Hadleigh,
and I wasn’t hired by him.’</p>

<p>‘Daresay he contracted with some un?’</p>

<p>A nod would be the response to his inquisitive
friend; and Caleb would proceed with his work
as earnestly as if his life depended upon accomplishing
a given task within the day. His
example inspired the younger men with some
spirit of emulation, and the women, old and
young, with admiration. The old stagers bluntly
told him at the close of the first day that they
could not keep pace with him, and did not mean
to try.</p>

<p>‘Do the best you can, lads, and you’ll satisfy
me,’ was all he said.</p>

<p>The whispers as to his treason to the cause of
the ‘Union,’ which floated about, and of which
he was perfectly conscious, had no other effect
upon him than to make him labour with increased
zeal. But he smarted inwardly; for, like all
popular leaders, he felt keenly the signs of waning
favour amongst his followers&mdash;felt them the more
keenly because he had so often, to his own serious
detriment, proved his integrity, and knew that
he was faithful as ever to the cause he had
espoused.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if he would have been able to
hold up so stoutly against the swelling tide of
unpopularity, if there had not been a compensating
influence upon him, strengthening his arm,
although it did not always keep his head cool, or
his pulse steady.</p>

<p>Every morning, when the white mist was rising
from the hollows, and the trees appeared through
it like shadows of themselves, whilst the long
grass through which he tramped to the field
sparkled and glowed around him, as the sun
cleared the atmosphere, his way took him by the
gardener’s cottage. Every evening, when the
harvest-moon was rising slowly over the tree-tops,
his way homeward took him again by the cottage.
He frequently caught a glimpse of Pansy, and
generally had an opportunity of exchanging greetings
with her.</p>

<p>‘A fine morning,’ he would say; and he was
under the impression that he spoke with a smile,
but always looked as solemn as if he were at a
funeral.</p>

<p>‘Yes, a fine morning,’ she would say with a
real smile, and a tint on her cheeks as if they
reflected the radiance of the sun.</p>

<p>Then he would stand as if he had something
more to say; but first he had to look up at the
sky; next strain his eyes over the rolling-ground
in the direction of the Forest, as if much depended
upon his noting the development of the trees
through the mist; and again up at the chimney-top,
to observe which way the wind was blowing.
The result of all this observation being:</p>

<p>‘We’ll have a rare drying wind to-day.’</p>

<p>Then she, in a modified way, would go through
the same pantomime and answer pleasantly; ‘Yes,
I think you will.’</p>

<p>And he would pass on, leaving that great ‘something’
he wanted to say still unspoken. Yet
Caleb was reputed to be a man possessed of a
special gift of speech. He showed no lack of it
in the presence of any one save Pansy.</p>

<p>‘I wonder what gars him come round this way
ilka mornin’ and night,’ said Sam Culver one
day to his daughter, looking at her suspiciously.
‘He’d be far sooner hame if he gaed round by
the wood, like other folk.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell, father,’ she answered, her gypsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">{133}</span>
cheeks aglow: ‘maybe he has to go up to the
House for something.’</p>

<p>Sam shook his head thoughtfully: he did not
relish the idea which had entered it.</p>

<p>‘Kersey is a decent enough lad; but he is
wildish in his notions of things, and a’ the farmers
round about are feared to trust him with ony
work. That’s no the right way to get through the
world, my lass, and I wouldna like to see you
with sic a man.’</p>

<p>Pansy was a little startled by this plain way
of suggesting why Caleb chose to take the longest
route to his work; and she proceeded hurriedly
to clear away the breakfast dishes. That evening,
Caleb did not see her as he passed the cottage.</p>

<p>Whatever Sam Culver’s opinion of Caleb Kersey
might have been, it underwent considerable modification,
if not an entire change, as he watched him
work and the harvest rapidly drawing to a close
under his care. At anyrate, one evening, as
Caleb was exchanging that stereotyped greeting
with Pansy, and was about to pass on, her father
came up and asked him in to supper.</p>

<p>‘It’s just a plate o’ porridge and milk, you ken;
but you’re welcome, if yer not ower proud to sup
it. Mony’s the great man has sought naething
better.’</p>

<p>A little shyness on Caleb’s part was quickly
overcome. He entered the cottage, and was presently
seated at the same table with Pansy. He
was amply compensated for all that he had suffered
on account of yielding to Madge’s request
that he should take the Ringsford harvest in
hand.</p>

<p>The gardener, since he had settled in the south,
had, like many of his countrymen, considerably
loosened the Puritanical stays which he had been
accustomed to wear in the north. Indeed, it was
said that he had been discovered in the greenhouse
on a Sabbath, when he ought to have
been in church. He still, however, felt the influence
of old habits, and so he said grace in this
fashion:</p>

<p>‘Fa’ tae, fa’ tae, and thank the Lord for a guid
supper.’</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, Sam took his
guest out to see a new geranium which he was
cultivating; and then he revealed to him a fancy
which he had been cultivating as largely as his
geranium.</p>

<p>‘I was thinking, Kersey, that you have been
getting on bravely with the harvest. Noo, if you
could just manage to cut the last stook on the
day of Mr Philip’s dinner, it would be a real
surprise to the folk at the house, and a grand
feather in your cap.’</p>

<p>‘I think it can be done,’ said Caleb quietly.</p>

<p>And it was done. On the evening fixed for
the festival, the last sheaf of the Ringsford grain
was placed on the lawn in front of the Manor.
Whilst the guests were arriving, Madge had
been told by Sam Culver that this was to be
done; so she went out with Uncle Dick and Mr
Hadleigh to congratulate Caleb on the good
harvest he had gathered in, and to thank him on
her own part for having undertaken the task.</p>

<p>‘It’s the best job you have ever done, Caleb,’
cried Uncle Dick, giving him a hearty slap on the
shoulder. ‘Stick to this kind of thing, my lad,
and leave speechifying to them that cannot do
any better.’</p>

<p>‘I am always ready to work,’ replied Caleb,
avoiding the second part of his well-wisher’s
speech.</p>

<p>‘I offer you my sincere thanks, Kersey,’ said
Mr Hadleigh in his reserved way; ‘and it would
please me to hear of anything I could do for
you.’</p>

<p>‘I am obliged to you.’</p>

<p>This ungraciously, but with a slight movement
of the head, which might be called half a nod.</p>

<p>‘You can bear it in mind. Had I known that
you would be finished to-day, I should have
arranged for our harvest-home gathering to take
place this evening. I am sure that would have
gratified Miss Heathcote and my son.’</p>

<p>Another half-nod, and Caleb moved away.</p>

<p>The gong sounded. Mr Hadleigh gave his
arm to Madge, and led her towards the house.</p>

<p>As they entered the hall, they were met by
the butler.</p>

<p>‘Do you know where Mr Philip is, sir?’ asked
the man nervously. ‘Dinner is quite ready, and
he is not in the house; and nobody has seen him
since he started for town this morning.’</p>

<p>The butler’s anxiety was equally divided
between the danger of having the dinner spoiled
and the question as to what had become of
Philip.</p>

<p>‘Have you sent to his room?’</p>

<p>‘I have been there myself, sir. His things are
all lying ready for him; but he is nowhere
about.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh frowned.</p>

<p>‘This is very annoying. I told him he should
not go to town to-day. He has missed his train,
I suppose. Give him a quarter of an hour, Terry,
and then serve dinner.... Excuse me, Miss
Heathcote, one moment.’</p>

<p>He beckoned to a footman, who followed him
into a small sideroom.</p>

<p>‘Send Cone to the station,’ he said in a low
voice; ‘and bid him inquire if there has been an
accident on the line.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.&mdash;THE BANQUET WAITS.</h3>

<p>The explanation that Philip, having important
business in town, had no doubt been detained
so long as to have missed his train, satisfied all
the guests except one. She, however, maintained
as calm a demeanour as Mr Hadleigh himself;
and he regarded her at times with a curiously
thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>‘How brave she is,’ was his thought. ‘Can
she have misgivings and he so firm?’</p>

<p>Madge had misgivings; for Philip had told her
that he had only to put his seal on the despatch-box
containing the important papers he was to
carry with him to Uncle Shield, and that he
expected to return early enough to call at Willowmere
before going home. This, she had suggested,
would be waste of time, for she would be busy
with her elaborate toilet, and unable to see him.
They both enjoyed the fun of the idea that she
should be so long engaged in dressing for this
important occasion as to leave no time to see
him.</p>

<p>‘Well, I shall see Uncle Dick at anyrate, and
of course he will be a first-rate substitute. Indeed,
now I think of it, he would be far more interesting
than a coquettish young person whose mind is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">{134}</span>
wholly absorbed in the arrangement of her bows
and laces. He would tell me all about the spread
of the foot-and-mouth disease, and that would be
useful information at anyrate. Eh?’</p>

<p>They parted, laughing, and thus it was only
a half-promise that he should call. She was not
surprised, therefore, when he did not appear.</p>

<p>When, however, the hour of dinner at the
Manor arrived and he had not yet returned, she
felt that vague anxiety which is almost more
difficult to hide in the presence of others than the
pain of some definite calamity. She knew quite
well that if he had only missed a train, he would
have telegraphed. But no one looking at her
would have suspected that her mind was disturbed
by the least unhappy thought.</p>

<p>Miss Hadleigh only said: ‘That careless boy!
To be late on such an occasion as this when he
knows that papa is always put out when anybody
is late’&mdash;and went on doing her best to remember
her duty as a hostess by not giving all her
attention to ‘Alfred.’ Miss Caroline only whispered
in reply: ‘He is so stupid.’ As for Miss
Bertha, she was so busily engaged in conversation
with one of her brother Coutts’s friends, that
she was unconscious of any disarrangement of
the evening’s programme.</p>

<p>So the party in the drawing-room buzzed like
a hive of contented bees on a warm summer day,
and no one showed the slightest symptom of
being aware that the hour appointed for dinner
had passed.</p>

<p>The vicar, Paul Havens, was a hale, sunny-faced
man of about fifty years, with bushy iron-gray
hair and whiskers, and square muscular
frame. He was one of those men whose strong,
kindly nature reflects itself upon all who come
in contact with him, and inspires them too with
a sense of strength. His genial presence was
like fresh air in the mansion or the peasant’s
cot. He was no ‘sporting parson;’ but he chatted
with Crawshay with as much interest as if he
were, about the prospects of sport on the stubble
this season, and how the pheasants were likely
to turn out when their time came. Then, as
Dr Guy came up, the vicar turned to little
Mrs Joy in time to relieve her from utter distraction
at the cynical jokes and compliments of
Coutts Hadleigh. The latter delighted in bewildering
this good lady, whose wits were not particularly
quick, although, with her husband,
Dr Edwin Joy, she was an enthusiastic social
reformer.</p>

<p>‘My husband and I believe,’ she would say,
with her little head bending slightly to one side,
‘that want of thrift is at the bottom of all the
poverty and misery of the working-classes in
town and country. Now we endeavour to inculcate
that great fact on all who come under our
influence; and Dr Joy, as my father’s partner,
you know, has many opportunities for speaking
a word in season. And we always speak it!
Thrift, thrift, thrift, is our text; and I assure you
we have succeeded in making <i>some</i> improvements
in our district.’</p>

<p>And they did preach from this text with
untiring enthusiasm; they diligently perused
every book and pamphlet published on the subject,
and their own affairs were continually in
a hopeless muddle. They could always see
exactly what other people ought to do under
any given circumstances, and were always ready
with the best advice; but they were like children
in dealing with the most ordinary difficulties
of their own lives. They were a good-natured
couple, however, thoroughly sincere and well
meaning, so that these little idiosyncrasies amused
their friends, and did no harm to the working-people
on whose behalf they were specially
exercised.</p>

<p>Mrs Joy’s father, Dr Guy, smiled grimly at
the profound wisdom they displayed in other
people’s business, and the folly which invariably
cropped up whenever they had anything to do
for themselves. At the beginning of every year,
they made a serious calculation of the least
amount their income was likely to be for the
coming twelve months, and resolved to live within
it; they even determined to lay aside some
portion to meet contingencies. At the end of
every year, they were amazed to find how far
they had exceeded their calculated expenditure,
and spent days in wondering how it could be.</p>

<p>‘Edwin, I cannot understand it,’ Mrs Joy would
exclaim helplessly.</p>

<p>‘Neither can I,’ he would answer with a puzzled
look at the figures before him. Then, brightening
up, he would say: ‘We must try again, my
dear.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we must try again, dear,’ she would say,
also brightening up, and comforted by visions of
the surplus which the mighty thrift would give
them next time.</p>

<p>Then they would make another serious calculation
of ways and means, and with light hearts,
go on just as before, studying and preaching the
doctrines which, by some inscrutable twist in
their natures, they were unable to practise. They
were so like children playing at housekeeping,
that although Dr Guy had to bear the consequences
of their mismanagement, he could not
be angry with them long at a time. Besides, he
had consolation in two facts: first, that Fanny
was his only child, and would inherit everything
he possessed; and second, that Edwin Joy was
really a clever surgeon, successful in his practice,
and much liked by his patients, notwithstanding
his stupidity in money matters. Indeed, the
greater part of the practice rested on his shoulders
now, and nothing delighted him more than to
be up to the eyes in work.</p>

<p>Dr Guy belonged to the old school of country
practitioners, and was as much interested in
agriculture as in physic. He had a small farm,
in the management of which he found agreeable
occupation. So he took the first opportunity of
getting Crawshay into a corner to discuss the
best means of stamping out the rapidly spreading
foot-and-mouth disease and the advantages
of ensilage.</p>

<p>Madge and Mrs Crawshay looking on, were well
pleased to see that for once Uncle Dick did not
regret coming to Ringsford. But although Madge
found time to think of this, and to give intelligent
attention to any one who addressed her,
she glanced often at the door expectantly.</p>

<p>At length the door opened, the butler entered,
spoke a few words to his master, and then withdrew.
Mr Hadleigh immediately advanced to
Madge.</p>

<p>‘I am glad to tell you, Philip has returned,’ he
said in a quiet voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">{135}</span></p>

<p>A flush of pleasure on her calm face expressed
her gratitude for this good news.</p>

<p>‘Then he was only detained&mdash;nothing has
happened?’</p>

<p>‘I presume that nothing particular has happened;
but we shall learn presently from himself.
His message to me was only to desire that we
should proceed to dinner at once, and allow him
to join us in the dining-room. So you must
permit Coutts to take you down.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CALLS_BEFORE_THE_CURTAIN">CALLS BEFORE THE CURTAIN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has often been said that an actor exists upon
the breath of applause; and to a certain extent
this is literally as well as figuratively true; for
during a long period of his early career he is
fated to undergo many hardships, and frequently
finds himself playing week after week for one of
those unscrupulous ‘managers’ who can hardly
be got to pay their company their salaries,
while revelling in all possible comfort themselves.
Indeed, a long chapter might be
written upon the sorrows incident to ‘the
profession;’ but this would be entirely beside
our present purpose. Suffice it to remark, as an
introduction to our immediate theme, that no
histrion ever yet trod the boards who was
unmindful of the public recognition of his talents;
and so soon as an opportunity offers in which to
distinguish himself, and his efforts are rewarded
with a round of applause, from that moment will
he devote himself the more assiduously to his
calling, by reason of the enviable stimulus so
received.</p>

<p>It has been placed upon record how Fanny
Horton, a once celebrated actress, won her first
applause in a somewhat singular manner. During
her performance in a particular scene, she was
loudly hissed, when, advancing to the footlights,
she asked: ‘Which do you dislike&mdash;my playing
or my person?’ ‘The playing, the playing!’ was
the answer from all parts of the house. ‘Well,’
she returned, ‘that consoles me; for my playing
may be bettered, but my person I cannot alter!’
The audience were so struck with the ingenuity
of this retort, that they immediately applauded
as loudly as they had the moment before condemned
her; and from that night she improved
in her acting, and soon became a favourite with
the public.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be denied that applause is not
only welcome, but necessary to the actor; and
even so great an artiste as Mrs Siddons was
susceptible to the force of this truth, though not
so much in its regard to professional adulation,
as for personal convenience. ‘It encourages,’ she
was wont to say; ‘and better still, it gives time
for breath!’ On this account, as well as for
other obvious reasons, the managers of the
Parisian theatres have organised a regular system
of hired applause, termed the <i>claque</i>; and this not
only saves the audience the trouble of applauding,
but it is frequently the means of influencing
the success of a new production, while
it affords the actors engaged an opportunity of
purchasing a too frequently questionable notoriety
by a monetary arrangement with the <i>claque</i>, or at
anyrate with the head of that department who
grandiloquently styles himself ‘the contractor for
success.’</p>

<p>But it must not by any means be imagined
that the <i>claque</i> is a modern institution. From
the time of the ancient drama downwards, the
approbation of the spectators has always been
eagerly courted by the performers, and hired
persons to applaud their acting regularly attended
the representations. Both the Greeks and the
Romans made use of the device. It has been well
attested that Nero, the Roman emperor, who at
all times took an active part in the theatrical
representations of his day, enforced applause at
the point of the sword; and Suetonius tells us
that one day when Nero sang the fable of <i>Atis
and the Bacchantes</i>, he deputed Burrhus and Seneca
to incite the audience to applaud. On one occasion,
while the emperor was on the stage, singing
to his own accompaniment on the lyre, an earthquake
shook the imperial city; yet not one
among that enormous assemblage dared so much as
attempt to flee from the danger, or leave his seat,
fearing the summary wrath of the tyrant, whose
will held them so powerfully in bondage. At
another time, a poor woman fell asleep during
the performance, and on one of Nero’s soldiers
descrying her situation, she narrowly escaped
with her life.</p>

<p>But the Romans could not give Nero the
honour of a call before the curtain, for the simple
reason that drop-curtains were not then in use.
Indeed, the introduction of stage-curtains belongs
to a comparatively late period. In the reign of
Elizabeth, we find that the theatres&mdash;or playhouses,
as they were termed&mdash;were of the most
primitive kind. For the most part the performances
were conducted on a rude platform in the
London inn yards; while the few regular
stationary playhouses were little better furnished
in the way of proper dramatic accessories. The
use of scenery is, of course, nowhere to be traced,
and the only semblance to a proscenium consisted
of a pair of tapestry curtains, which were drawn
aside by cords when the performance began. The
same arrangement has also been found in all
examples of the early Spanish, Portuguese, and
other continental theatres.</p>

<p>Among the earliest permanent English playhouses
were ‘The Theatre’ and ‘The Fortune,’
neither of which, however, possessed a proper
drop-curtain. But ‘The Red Bull,’ another old
theatre, had a drop-curtain; and when, in the
year 1633, that playhouse was demolished, rebuilt,
and enlarged, it was decorated in a manner almost
in advance of the time, the management particularly
priding itself upon ‘a stage-curtain of pure
Naples silk.’ It was not until the year 1656 that
the first attempt of Sir William Davenant to
establish the lyric drama in England brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">{136}</span>
with it the use of regular painted scenery on our
stage. As an introductory venture, and fully
aware that the performance of everything of a
dramatic tendency had long been prohibited
throughout the country, he announced a miscellaneous
kind of entertainment, consisting of ‘music
and declamation,’ which was duly held at Rutland
House in Charterhouse Yard, on the 23d
of May. Thus far encouraged, he immediately
followed with the first genuine opera, entitled
<i>The Siege of Rhodes</i>, employing a libretto, music,
costumes, and five elaborate scenes. Further
representations of opera were always signalised
by the use of scenery, and the example was
naturally soon followed by the drama, so soon as
the altered condition of the times had sufficiently
permitted its revival. In place of a drop-curtain
of tapestry, silk, or other material, a painted
scene also came into fashion, on which was generally
shown some incident in the opera about to
be enacted. The painted crimson curtain used
in <i>The Siege of Rhodes</i> had upon it also a representation
of the arms and military trophies of the
several nations which took part in this memorable
siege.</p>

<p>Still, for all that, the green curtain retained its
position in all permanent theatres&mdash;and even in
the puppet-shows, so popular in their day&mdash;nor
was it until quite recently that the more fashionable
houses thought proper to dispense with it
altogether.</p>

<p>Touching upon stage-curtains of our own time,
it will scarcely be necessary to dilate upon the
peculiarly constructed proscenium of the present
Haymarket Theatre, London, which is nothing
more or less than an elaborate picture in its gilt
frame. The curtain of course forms the picture,
and no orchestra-pew being visible, the frame or
proscenium is continued on the lower side without
interruption. The footlights are not discovered
until the rising of the curtain, and the ‘calls’ are
necessarily responded to on the stage itself, for
which purpose the curtain is again drawn up.
Perhaps the most interesting curtain of the ordinary
character is that now in use at New Sadler’s
Wells Theatre, which conveys to the eye a very
perfect idea of that famous ‘musick-house’ on the
banks of the New River in ‘merrie Islington,’ as
it appeared rather more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Mr Henry Irving in his established dramatic
home at the Lyceum Theatre has always preferred
to take his ‘calls’ on the stage itself; indeed, he
never appears in front of the curtain except on
the night of the opening or the termination of
his season, which is always looked forward to in
London as an event. The production of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> afforded him an agreeable opportunity,
however, of making a new departure in his
manner of responding to the congratulations of
his patrons&mdash;the living ‘Prologue’ opening the
tragedy by stepping forward from between a pair
of truly magnificent curtains of yellow plush,
when, having recited his lines, the withdrawal
of these curtains unveiled the first scene representing
‘the public place’ at Verona. Mr Irving,
further, took occasion at the close of each act
of leading Miss Ellen Terry before the footlights
in the same manner, thus obviating the necessity
of raising the curtain proper before these calls
could be replied to.</p>

<p>So much for theatrical curtains in general. We
will now go on to narrate several notable incidents
connected with ‘Calls before the Curtain.’</p>

<p>When David Garrick made his re-appearance at
Drury Lane, after an absence of two years during
a provincial tour, the theatre was packed from
floor to ceiling, and the audience were quite
beside themselves with enthusiasm. The play
was announced to be <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>;
but, as the actor expected, he had first to show
himself in front of the curtain. He had prepared
an address to the audience, which he delivered
previous to beginning the play. When he came
upon the stage, he was welcomed with three loud
plaudits, each finishing with a huzza.</p>

<p>When R. W. Elliston was manager of the ‘Royal
Circus,’ to which he gave the present name of the
‘Surrey Theatre,’ he was one night called before
the curtain under rather exceptional circumstances.
On that occasion, an actor named Carles, who had
long been a popular favourite at that house, was
absent, having unfortunately been arrested for
debt while on his way to the theatre, and another
actor, possibly not very much his inferior in
regard to talent, had to be substituted. The
performance, however, had not long commenced,
when the audience missed their favourite, and
called loudly for ‘Carles!’ Carles not appearing,
the uproar became general; and as soon as the
curtain had fallen upon the first act, the manager
was summoned. Elliston duly appeared and
asked, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, what is your
pleasure?’ But to all that he said they cried only
‘Carles!’ Not yet aware of their intentions, he
exclaimed: ‘One at a time, if you please;’ and
singling out a puny yet over-energetic malcontent
in the pit, he begged pardon of the audience,
saying: ‘Let me hear what <i>this</i> gentleman has
to say.’ Then addressing the man: ‘Now, sir,
I’ll attend to you <i>first</i>, if the rest of the gentlemen
will allow me.’</p>

<p>The man, as might be imagined, was not a little
taken aback at this remark; yet he managed to
say: ‘Carles’ name is in the bill, and where is he?’
At this, Elliston assumed a grave air, and folding
his arms, addressed the people as follows:
‘Ladies and gentlemen, with your leave I will say
a few words. I admit that Mr Carles’ name <i>is</i>
in the bill; I do not wish to deny it; but’&mdash;here
he assumed a decidedly tragic tone&mdash;‘but are you
to be reminded of the many accidents that may
intervene between the issuing of that bill and
the evening’s fulfilment of its promise? Is it
requisite to remind the enlightened and thinking
portion of the public here assembled that the
chances and changes of human life are dependent
upon circumstances, and not upon ourselves?’</p>

<p>Here all shouted: ‘Ay, ay; bravo!’</p>

<p>The manager, pointing to the man in the pit,
went on: ‘And you, sir, who are so loud in your
demand for Mr Carles, cannot <i>you</i> also imagine
that his absence may be occasioned by some sore
distress, some occurrence not within human foresight
to anticipate or divert? Cannot you picture
to yourself the possibility of Mr Carles at this
moment lying upon a sick&mdash;nay, perhaps a dying
bed, surrounded by his weeping children and his
agonised wife’ [Mr Carles was a bachelor!], ‘whose
very bread depends upon the existence of an
affectionate devoted husband and father, and who
<i>may</i> be deprived of his exertions and support for
ever? Is it so <i>very</i> difficult to imagine a scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">{137}</span>
like this taking place at the very moment when
you are calling for him so imperiously to appear
before you, selfishly desirous of your present
amusement and unmindful of his probable danger!’
Great and general applause.</p>

<p>Inwardly, Mr Elliston felt struck at the success
of his diplomacy, especially as at this point the
audience turned against the man who had spoken,
and joined their voices in cries of ‘Turn
him out!’ to which sentence the manager found
it best to lend countenance; and having given his
permission, the unlucky ‘pitite’ was summarily
ejected from the theatre, and in a little while the
performance was continued in perfect order.</p>

<p>Calls for the author after the first representation
of a new play are, of course, frequent, the
more especially when the work has given entire
satisfaction. In some instances, the audience
summon that individual to appear for no other
purpose than to hiss him for the unskilfulness of
his performance; in which case, the author will
most probably retaliate with a speech wherein
mention of ‘an organised opposition’ comes uppermost.
Speaking of the former, some curious
examples might be noted. An author frequently
announces, through the medium of the manager,
that he has betaken himself abroad, or, say, to
Scotland, fearing the result of his piece, whereas
he may be quietly looking on at the back of the
pit, or has concealed himself behind the curtains
of a private box. In another case, the successful
author will attempt to make a speech, while
bowing his acknowledgments, and signally fail,
retiring considerably more abashed than triumphant.
But the crowning episode to be narrated
in this connection occurred some years ago at one
of the Dublin theatres, when one of the tragedies
of Sophocles was put on the stage. At the close
of the performance, the ‘gods’ loudly called for
the author; whereupon the manager explained
that as the author had been dead more than two
thousand years, he could not very well appear.
Nothing disconcerted, a very small gallery-boy
called out: ‘Then let’s have his mummy!’</p>

<p>Dramatic, including operatic, artistes taking
their benefits are almost invariably honoured with
a call before the curtain. On such occasions, too,
they may fairly be entitled to considerable latitude
in various ways, as, for instance, in their own
selection of the programme for that evening.
Notwithstanding this, they should not suffer
themselves to infringe the ordinary regulations
of the establishment. Not very long ago, a star
<i>prima donna</i> of the very first magnitude, when
taking her benefit at the Imperial Opera, St
Petersburg, found herself called before the curtain
more than twenty consecutive times. In the end
she occupied the centre of the stage, and addressed
her enthusiastic patrons a few words in the
Russian language, then offered to show her gratitude
for their favours by singing them a song
in their own tongue. This was received with
rapturous applause; but judge of her surprise
when, after retiring from the stage, the management
fined her two thousand francs for addressing
the audience without permission! The proceeds
of her benefit were thus considerably reduced;
and her experience was only in one degree
removed from that of the French pantomimist
and dancer, as related by Charles Kemble. This
individual was in the habit of taking a benefit at
regular intervals, but always with a loss. One
night, however, he came before the curtain with
a beaming countenance, and after a polite bow, he
acknowledged his thanks in these terms: ‘Dear
public, moche oblige; very good benefice; only
lose half a crown dis time. <i>I come again!</i>’</p>

<p>At an American theatre, an actor once took
his benefit, and selected as the play for the
occasion, <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>. The company being
small, he found it necessary not only to subject
several of the incidental characters to being
doubled&mdash;that is, one actor to sustain two different
characters in the same piece, rapidly changing
his costume from one to the other as occasion
requires&mdash;but he also accepted a double himself.
His was that of Sambo with St Clair. St Clair
appears in one act, and Sambo in the next.
Having won considerable honours as the first
individual, the actor, directly the curtain had
descended, hurried away to his dressing-room to
prepare in all haste his toilet and costume for
Sambo. His face and hands had of course to
be blacked; and in the midst of this operation
of applying the burnt cork, the prompter entered
his room to announce that the audience were
uproarious for him to appear before the curtain.
‘But I can’t,’ he exclaimed; ‘it is impossible;
I’m just making up for Sambo!’ Nothing, however,
would satisfy his patrons short of responding
to his call; so boisterously demanded, that,
without his compliance, the performance could
not possibly proceed. At length our hero made
his appearance. But the audience were scarcely
prepared to receive him in his altered person,
and, failing to recognise the metamorphosed St
Clair in the half-made-up Sambo, they shouted:
‘Go away! Who sent for you?’</p>

<p>Floral offerings are, of course, pleasantly associated
with artistes’ benefits, and long may they so
continue. The Emperor Nero, it is said, always
provided the Roman spectators with the thousand-and-one
bouquets which were thrown at his feet
when he occupied the stage. But bouquets
<i>voluntarily</i> offered are worthy to be prized very
highly. Not very long ago, Mr Edward Terry,
when taking his leave of an Irish audience, was
honoured with the reception of a beautiful floral
wreath, which must have been infinitely more
acceptable than that wreath of <i>immortelles</i> which
some insulting ruffian cast at the feet of Mademoiselle
Favart, at a French theatre, a few years
ago, in order to indicate that her age had placed
her beyond the power of playing youthful parts.
Had she been composed of the same metal as was
the actor in the following example, she would
have enjoyed the opportunity presented of paying
the wretch back in his own coin. The story may
be accepted as true.</p>

<p>At the close of his own benefit performance,
a certain favourite comedian was called before
the curtain at a theatre in Vienna. In the midst
of a shower of bouquets, some insulting individual
threw a bunch of vegetables on the stage. Very
complacently the <i>bénéficier</i>, having marked from
what portion of the house it had proceeded, picked
up the article, and said: ‘We have here an
interesting collection of carrots and turnips.
From my slight knowledge of natural history,
I believe this to be the proper food for asses; I
therefore return it to its owner, for who knows
in these hard times he may be in want of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">{138}</span>
a meal in the morning!’ With these words, he
threw the object whence it came; and the
individual being discovered, was immediately
expelled from the theatre amid mingled hisses
and applause.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MINERS_PARTNER">THE MINER’S PARTNER.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER I.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.&mdash;CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a good deal of excitement in the
mining camps at and near Flume City, which,
as every mining reader knows, was prominent
among the gold-diggings, and gold-washings also,
of Colorado twenty years ago. A meeting of
miners was being held at the largest building in
the city&mdash;a wooden shed, which called itself a
restaurant, at which there were assembled some
forty or fifty men, rough-looking, roughly clad,
and armed with revolver and knife, although
no intention existed of using such weapons at
this gathering. The assembly, indeed, had been
called together with an object calculated to promote
union and comradeship&mdash;to assist in maintaining
individual rights and to support the law
generally.</p>

<p>There was a president, of course, and his discourse,
if not polished, was much to the point.
‘I reckon,’ he said, after the meeting had lasted
perhaps an hour, and several speeches had been
made, with a good deal of shouting in the way
of approval&mdash;‘I reckon that the citizens who have
spoken are about right. We have got some
traitors among us, and that’s where the worst
comes in. It wasn’t by chance that any outside
loafer knew just when to steal the washings at
the Long Placer last night, or that Scotch Ned
was sent away when the stamp-mill was broken.
We know who broke the mill&mdash;it was Bill Dobell.
But who told him to come in then? And who
could have known that the Kentucky boys at
the Long Placer had got the best washings they
had seen this year? Who could have known that
but one among us?’</p>

<p>The president said much more to this effect;
but the remainder of his speech, with the various
orations which followed, need not be given, as
we have shown what was the nature of the
excitement which had called the miners into
solemn conclave.</p>

<p>The language used was odd and quaint enough;
to many it would have sounded absurd in its
phraseology; but no fault could have been found
with the matter. That was direct and shrewd,
and evinced a strong determination to put down
the mischief which was making itself felt.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of a pithy harangue, in
which the speaker urged vigorous and brief
proceedings against any one detected in such
unpardonable conduct, or reasonably suspected
of complicity in the crime&mdash;for robbing the
troughs in a mining country is looked upon as
worse than murder, and is considered to be quite
as bad as horse-stealing&mdash;a voice exclaimed: ‘You
air right, colonel!’</p>

<p>Every one started at the sound, and looked in
the direction of the speaker, who, having recently
joined the meeting, with several others, stood
near the door. A dozen men whispered to their
next neighbours: ‘Why, it is Rube Steele!’ And
significant glances were exchanged.</p>

<p>‘I thought the other day there was Injuns
lying around to thieve,’ continued the man; ‘so,
when’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You told us so, Rube,’ interrupted the president;
‘and the Kentucky boys from the Long
Placer came into committee on the subject; and
their troughs were robbed while they were gone.
You know <i>that</i>, I estimate?’</p>

<p>A murmur as of approval of the president’s
language ran through the meeting. Rube noted
this, but it did not disturb him. A peculiarly
sinister glance which he threw around him was
perhaps natural to his not greatly attractive
features.</p>

<p>‘Yes; I expect I know that; and I expect that
I know the tale about the Injuns was a fraud,’
returned Rube. Something like a sarcastically
approving laugh ran through the meeting at
these words; but the speaker continued, without
appearing to notice it: ‘That stranger from
San Francisco was the man who brought the
news. You believed him; so did I.’</p>

<p>‘We believed you, Rube; you said the man
was reliable,’ again interrupted the president.</p>

<p>‘That is so,’ replied Rube. ‘He brought
messages from leading Frisco citizens, men known
to me, and so I believed him. But I tell you he
is no good; and he has gone off with nigh upon
three thousand dollars in gold-dust which I trusted
to him. He brought me an order from Ben, my
pardner, to say he was to have the dust; and
though I did not like the idea, I parted with
it. And on coming into camp and asking Ben
about it, I find he never gave any order at
all. And it is my belief that this is the man
who robbed the washings at the Kentucky boys’
placer.’</p>

<p>‘And where is Ben?’ began the president, who
would probably have said more, but that a man
burst hastily into the saloon as the question was
asked, and shouted in answer: ‘Here! Here is
Reuben Steele’s pardner. Who wants him?’</p>

<p>‘We want you to hear what has been said,’
returned the president, ‘and to give us your
opinion about Californy Jones&mdash;the stranger who
was introduced by your pardner, but who, Rube
now says, is the man who robbed the placer, and
has robbed him of three thousand dollars.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t say anything about the placer; maybe
Rube knows more about that than I do,’ replied
the new-comer. ‘But the man has gone off with
three thousand dollars; that’s a sure fact; and
as Rube gave him the dust, it’s a sure fact too,
he knows more about that than I do.’</p>

<p>‘I know no more than yourself,’ retorted
Rube. ‘The man produced an order from you.
I could not tell that it was a forgery, and you
have always considered yourself as the boss of our
outfit.’</p>

<p>‘Wal, gentlemen, and Mr President,’ continued
Ben, ‘I can tell you we have got murderers among
us. Yes, gentlemen, that is so&mdash;real cold-blooded
murderers, that will lie in wait for honest, law-abiding
citizens and shoot them from behind
rocks.’</p>

<p>A louder murmur ran through the assembly
here; and the president asked Ben his meaning.</p>

<p>‘My meaning is this,’ continued Ben. ‘You
know I am clearing out, and shall leave the camp
in a day or two, so that we are realising all our
property, and this gold-dust was a part of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">{139}</span>
I am going East with. So, I kinder felt like
riled at losing it; and when my pardner told
me, as cool as maybe, that he concluded this
stranger had vamoosed with my dust’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘And mine!’ interjected Rube.</p>

<p>‘Wal, let every man speak of his own business,’
returned Ben, who was evidently in anything but
a good temper. ‘I say he had cleared out with
mine, anyhow; and I was riled, I tell you. But
at that minute, I saw, crossing the Mule Back
Ridge, two men on horseback. The Ridge is
distant a good piece; but I could swear one was
that stranger. “Send some of the boys on,” said
I to Rube. “I shall go through the cañon, so
shall meet them. They must cross there, if
they don’t mean to go into the mountains.”
And I was sure they did not want the mountain
road. So I sot off. But I was waited for. There
are as bad men left in the camp as have gone
out of it; and at the very entrance of the cañon,
when them horsemen must have been a good two
miles away, some desperadoes fired at me from
behind a rock. There was more than one shot
fired at the same time, I know; and&mdash;see here,
Mr President!&mdash;they took good aim.’ As he
said this, he threw off his long outer coat, and
handed it to the president, who, after a momentary
examination, held it up, and exhibited an unmistakable
bullet-hole in the skirt.</p>

<p>‘That was near&mdash;that is a fact!’ exclaimed
the president. ‘And what did you do then?’</p>

<p>‘I turned back,’ said Ben. ‘It was of no use
my pushing on alone, with the rocks lined with
murderers, with men who expected me, and were
in league with Californy Jones.’</p>

<p>‘And where was Rube?’ asked the president.</p>

<p>‘I was at the head of a bunch of boys of the
right sort, seven or eight of them, that I had
looked up in the camp. They are here now:
Long Sim, Missouri Rob, Major Dimey and friend,
with some others, all first-class citizens.’</p>

<p>An assenting exclamation from each of those
he named confirmed the speaker.</p>

<p>‘I could not do more than that,’ continued
Rube. ‘And when I found my pardner on the
return-track, it was no use my proceeding. I
came back to the city, and then right away to
this here convention.’</p>

<p>‘I could have raised twice the force in a quarter
of the time he took!’ cried Ben, intercepting some
remark which it was evident the president was
about to make. ‘And why I did not come straight
here was because there was something in my tent
I thought I had best look after. I had left
my tent in the care of a friend; but you don’t
know what may happen, with such loafers and
scoundrels hanging around.’</p>

<p>‘Wal, fellow-citizens,’ said the president, ‘this
convention didn’t assemble, I reckon, to hear the
rights of any difference between two pardners;
and it ain’t our business nohow. We are here
to discuss the existence of thieves and scallawags
amongst us, and to decide upon the beet means of
clearing them out&mdash;that is all.’</p>

<p>Thus recalled to business, the assembly resumed
its former discussion, and the quarrel between
the partners was not again openly referred to;
but it coloured all that was said, and many
remarks upon it were made in the body of the
meeting. It was clear that public feeling was
much against Rube Steele, although a few of
those present were his partisans; but these latter
appeared to consist only of the ‘bunch’ of citizens
he had referred to, and were not altogether free
from suspicion themselves.</p>

<p>The gathering separated without having come
to any formal resolve, beyond appointing a few
of their members to act in committee and to
decide what steps should be taken; but as it
was notorious that each of the chosen ones was a
leader among the Regulators, as they were once
called&mdash;or the Vigilantes, to use their now
familiar Spanish name&mdash;there was probably more
significance in their appointment than at first
appeared.</p>

<p>For that night at anyrate no fresh outrages
were apprehended; the thieves, whoever they
were, possessed information too prompt and too
certain to allow them to venture on a renewal of
their attempts during the excitement and watchfulness
which would prevail for a time in the
vicinity of Flume City.</p>

<p>In its neighbourhood, few persons were abroad
after nightfall; it was dangerous, indeed, for any
one to approach a tent without making his
presence loudly known; a shot would probably
be the first intimation that he was trespassing
on dangerous ground; while a few of the miners
possessed large and savage dogs, which would be
loosed on hearing a footstep near the tent. So
those who had business which led them abroad,
were careful to confine themselves to the main
street of Flume City, if such a title could fitly
be applied to the straggling avenue which ran
from end to end of the place. But spite of these
drawbacks, a few persons were moving in the
environs of the city, and even at a good distance
beyond its boundaries, dark though the night
was, and only relieved from utter gloom by the
starlight, for moon there was none.</p>

<p>One man who was going towards the town,
stopped suddenly, as his quick ear caught the
sound of an approaching footstep, and with the
caution of one accustomed to frontier-life, drew
himself up by the side of one of the very few
trees which remained in the vicinity of Flume
City, so that in the obscurity it was almost
impossible for any passing eye to detect him.
The next instant a single man hurried by, passing
between the first comer and the starry sky, so
that his figure was visible with tolerable distinctness
to the concealed watcher. This second man
did not look to the right or left&mdash;it would have
been almost impossible for him to detect the spy,
had he done so&mdash;but went quickly on in a
direction which seemed to surprise the hidden
observer.</p>

<p>‘What can he want there?’ exclaimed the
latter, stepping from his hiding-place, when the
other had fairly gone past. ‘There ain’t no
shanties nor no living soul in that direction. It
was surely Rube Steele; and without he has
gone crazy, I can’t fix anyhow why he should be
going towards the cañon after nightfall. I will
see where he <i>is</i> going; and if he has turned
crazy, I may help him; and if not, I shall find
out what he wants in the mountain pass.</p>

<p>He was moving carefully but quickly in the
direction the other had taken, while he was
muttering these disinterested sentiments; and
although he could only see the figure he followed,
at intervals, when the man climbed a ledge and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">{140}</span>
stood for an instant in relief against the sky, yet
there was no difficulty in the pursuit. He could
hear his steps as they disturbed the loose stones
which strewed the way, and knew besides, that
in the wild spot which they had reached, there
was no means of turning to the right or left, so
that he could not easily miss the chase. Presently
the tread of the foremost man became
slower, and the pursuer, as a matter of course,
moved at a slower rate also&mdash;slower and slower
still, until the former stopped, or only moved
about the same spot of ground.</p>

<p>‘What on airth is he going to do?’ muttered
the other man. ‘It’s so dark&mdash;for he is right
under the shadow of Big Loaf Rock&mdash;that he
can’t see to dig, nor hunt after any buried&mdash;&mdash;
Wal! that means something!’ This exclamation
was caused by a low whistle which Rube
Steele&mdash;if indeed it were that person&mdash;suddenly
gave. This was repeated, and then answered
from a distance. ‘I feel like seeing the end of
this,’ continued the spy; ‘and I mean to.’</p>

<p>Acting upon this determination, he crawled
carefully forward, for he was too near to venture
upon standing upright; and moreover, as the
answering whistle had proved that others were
in the neighbourhood, he was compelled to be
on his guard against discovery from other
quarters. His quick ear soon caught the sound
of an approaching tread, and directly after, he
heard words spoken. The spy’s curiosity was
now raised tenfold, especially as one of the two
men who were now, as he well knew, close to
him, struck a match to light his pipe, and the
momentary flash showed him both figures in
a brief glimpse. They were unluckily placed
with their backs towards him, so that he could
not see their features. He now felt confident that
the first one was Rube Steele, and that the
second was not entirely unknown to him, but
more than this he could not tell.</p>

<p>This was terribly tantalising; and after the
brief illumination of the match, a more impenetrable
darkness seemed to have settled upon the
pass and the rocks around; so, at all hazards,
he resolved to get still nearer. He was perhaps a
little unguarded in his eagerness, and made some
slight noise, and it is certain that he had not
calculated all the hazards which might environ
him, for a low fierce growl showed that a dog
was with the men, and the spy shuddered with
horror as he heard the sound.</p>

<p>‘Did you hear anything?’ said a harsh voice.
‘The dog would not have growled like that, unless
some one was hanging around.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’ returned the other; and the voice
was certainly the voice of Rube Steele. ‘He
heard a jack-rabbit, perhaps, or scented a polecat.
I reckon there ain’t a soul within a league of
this cañon to-night. The miners are all at Flume
City, and the Indians have left the district for
more than a week past.’</p>

<p>‘You may be right,’ returned the first speaker.
‘But the dog is uneasy, and I never knew
him give them signs for game or venison; no,
nor for Injun neither. I should have said
there was a white man near. But we air a little
too much in the line of the main pass to show
a light, which we must do. Come behind this
rock.&mdash;Good dog!&mdash;mind ’em!’ These last words
were of course addressed to the dog, which had
continued to growl at intervals while his master
was speaking, although the unseen watcher had
lain as still as death. The animal was apparently
soothed by being thus noticed, and probably
followed the men, whose footsteps could be heard
as they removed to the proposed cover behind
the Big Loaf Rock.</p>

<p>The spy had no inclination to follow them to
learn more, but crawled carefully and noiselessly
over the ground until he was at a safe distance
from the pass; so far, indeed, that he judged that
even the acute ears and scent of the dog could
not detect him when he rose, and hurried in
the direction of the city as fast as his legs could
carry him.</p>

<p>On the outskirts, he knocked at the door of
a shanty, a log-built hut with earthen floor,
such as the Mexican peasantry, and even their
betters, often reside in; and in answer to a gruff
challenge from within&mdash;for the inmates were in
bed, or stretched on such pallets as served for
beds&mdash;he returned an answer which seemed to
satisfy the questioner, for after a little more gruff
grumbling, the door was opened, and he was
admitted.</p>

<p>In answer to his inquiry, the gruff voice said:
‘No; nary drop of anything but water; ye kin
have that. Your voice sounds all of a tremble,
Absalom; and if ye don’t get shot over the cards
or drown yourself, I guess ye won’t last long as
a miner, anyhow.’</p>

<p>Absalom, as he was called, hesitated for a
moment, as though about to say something in
his defence, but eventually decided on making
no reply to this rather unpleasant speech, and
threw himself down on a buffalo skin which the
other man pushed towards him. No further
conversation took place, and the shanty was as
dark and silent as were the remainder of the
scattered dwellings on the outskirts of Flume
City.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CURIOSITIES_OF_THE_ELECTRIC_LIGHT">CURIOSITIES OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first curiosity of the electric light was of
course its discovery in 1802 by Humphry
Davy, then an assistant-lecturer at the Royal
Institution. With one of the new batteries which
Volta had invented two years before, Davy was
surprised to get a brilliant white light when the
poles of the battery were joined through two
pieces of carbon. Later on, his astonishment was
increased when he found how intensely hot was
this ‘arch’ of carbon light&mdash;the hottest known
artificial source. ‘Platinum,’ he wrote, ‘was
melted as readily as is wax in the flame of a
common candle; quartz, the sapphire, magnesia,
lime, all entered into fusion.’ Even the diamond
swells out into a black mass in the electric arc,
and carbon itself has been known to soften.
Dr Siemens, as is well known, utilised this
fervent heat to fuse metals in a crucible. With
the arc from a dynamo capable of giving a
light of five thousand candles, he fused fifteen
pounds of broken files in as many minutes.
Indeed, the temperature of the arc ranges from
two thousand to five thousand degrees Centigrade.
Another curiosity of the arc is that it can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">{141}</span>
shown in water or other liquids without quenching.
Liquids have a diffusive action on the light; and
a globule of fused oxide of iron between platinum
wires conveying the current, produces a very fine
golden light. The fused plaster of Paris between
the carbons of the Jablochkoff candle also forms a
brilliant source of light in the arc; as does the
marble separator which answers the same purpose
in the <i>lampe soleil</i>. Indeed, this white-hot marble,
rendered luminous by the arc, gives out a mellow
radiance so closely resembling sunshine as to give
the lamp its name. Such a light is very suitable
for illuminating picture-galleries.</p>

<p>Electric light is also produced by sending a
discharge through vacuum tubes like those of
Geissler; and the varied colours thus produced
are exceedingly pretty. Phosphorescent substances,
too, such as the sulphide of barium, or
the platino-barium cyanide, become highly luminous
when inclosed in a tube and traversed by the
electric current.</p>

<p>Besides the voltaic arc, we have now, however,
another kind of electric light&mdash;namely, the
incandescence which is produced by sending the
current through a very slender filament of
platinum wire or carbon fibre inclosed in a glass
bulb exhausted of air. Such are the lamps of
Swan, Edison, and others. These lamps have
also their curious features. The temperature of
the filament is of course much lower than the
temperature of the arc. It is only about eighteen
hundred degrees Centigrade, for if it were higher,
the delicate filament would be dissipated into
vapour which would condense like smoke on the
cool glass. With a platinum filament, the metal
would ‘silver’ the interior of the bulb. Curiously
enough, when the copper ‘electrodes’ or wires
conveying the current inside the bulb to the
filament of an Edison lamp are accidentally
dissipated by excess of current, the carbon thread
seems to shelter the glass from the copper shower,
for Dr J. Fleming has observed that there is
always a blank line on the glass opposite the
filament, while all the rest is coated with a film
of copper. When the carbon itself is dissipated,
this blank line is not seen, and the whole interior
of the bulb appears to be smoked. According to
Dr Fleming, this means that the molecules of
copper move in straight lines in the vacuum.</p>

<p>During the ordinary action of one of these
lamps there is believed to be a kind of molecular
bombardment between the two sides of the carbon
filament, which is usually bent into a loop. This
battery of atoms in time disintegrates the filament
near its junction with the wires where it is
severest, and a patent has recently been taken
out by Mr Brush, the well-known inventor, for
the insertion of a mica screen between the
legs of the filament to shield them from the
pellets.</p>

<p>The spectrum of the voltaic arc consists of the
continuous ribbon spectrum of the white-hot solid
carbons, and certain bright lines due to the
glowing vapours of the arc. The light is rich in
the blue or actinic rays so productive of chemical
action, and hence it is, perhaps, that Dr Siemens
found it so effective in forcing fruit and flowers by
night in lieu of the sun. It helps the development
of chlorophyl; and perhaps the electricity
itself has also something to do with assisting
growth, apart from the light, for several French
experimenters have found that electrified soil
and air seem to foster plants better than unelectrified.
It is remarkable, too, that young bamboo
shoots grow very rapidly after the thunderstorms
which usher in the Indian monsoons.</p>

<p>The power of the arc-light is something unrivalled
by any other light, whether of limelight
or magnesium. At the famous Crystal
Palace Electrical Exhibition, an arc reputed to
be one hundred and fifty thousand candles in
power was lighted every evening. The carbons
were stout copper-plated bars nearly two and
a half inches thick. This intensity of illumination
renders the arc eminently adapted for
lighthouses and search-lights. Hence it is that
the French government have decided to light
forty of their coast lighthouses by electricity, and
that most of our warships and military trains are
now equipped with electric lamps for searching
purposes. We read that the fleet at Alexandria
explored the Egyptian forts by night with powerful
arcs; and that the French Admiral at Madagascar
struck terror into the breasts of the simple
Hovas by a similar display.</p>

<p>For scouring the sea in search of torpedo-boats
by night, or icebergs and other ships during a
fog, the value of the arc-light cannot be too
highly estimated. The screw-steamer <i>Faraday</i>,
while engaged some time ago in laying a new
Atlantic cable, would have run right into an
iceberg in a Newfoundland fog, but for the
electric beam projected from her bows into the
misty air ahead. Fog, however, has a peculiarly
strong quenching power over the arc-light,
owing to the preference it has for absorbing all
the blue rays, and to the comparative poverty
of the orange colour. Hence it is that electric
arc-lamps look so white and dim in a dense
fog. A single gas-jet can be seen about as
far as a two-thousand-candle arc-lamp. This
is because the gas-jet is rich in those red rays
which penetrate a fog without being absorbed;
whereas it is poor in the blue rays which are
quenched. For this reason, also, the incandescence
lamp is preferable to the arc for a misty atmosphere.</p>

<p>The incandescence lamp can also burn under
water, and owing to its pretty shape, its pure light,
its cleanliness, and independence of everything
except wires to bring the current to it, is highly
suitable for decorative purposes. It particularly
lends itself to ornamental devices of a floral order;
and a great variety of chandeliers and brackets
have now been designed representing various
plants with leaves of brass or filagree, and flowers
composed of tinted crystal cups containing the
lamps. Fruit is also simulated by lamps
of coloured glass. For example, at a Drury
Lane Christmas pantomime, both holly and
mistletoe berries were imitated by incandescence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">{142}</span>
lamps of crimson and opal glass. Artificial
lemon-trees, with fruit consisting of yellow
lamps, also make a pretty dining-table ornament.
So do vases of roses with incandescence
lamps hid in them, an ornament devised by
Mr J. W. Swan for his residence at Bromley.
Aquaria, too, can be lighted internally by
incandescence bulbs, and it would be very pretty
to see the lamps lying beside growing sea-anemones,
whose expansion might seem the more
lovely under the stimulus of their rays.</p>

<p>A Christmas-tree looks very pretty when lighted
by a hundred incandescence lamps; the first
attempted being in all probability that in the
Swedish section of the Electrical Exhibition held
in Paris two years ago. At the Vienna Electrical
Exhibition there are, while we write, some novel
effects of electric illumination; for instance, there
is a hall lighted entirely from the ceiling by electricity.
The ceiling is painted a deep blue to represent
the sky, and studded with innumerable stars
in the shape of incandescence lamps. This reminds
us of the allegorical sun produced in the window of
Mr Mayal, the well-known photographer, by means
of the same illuminant.</p>

<p>From its cool brightness and safety from fire,
the incandescence light is very well adapted for
theatres, and there are now several opera-houses
and theatres lighted by it. The Savoy Theatre,
London; the Princess’s Theatre, Manchester; the
Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, &amp;c., are all lit by
incandescence lamps owing to its brilliance as
compared with gas. Some change was necessary
in the making-up of the actors and actresses, and
the painting of the scenes; but at the New Grand
Theatre, Islington, the changes have been avoided
by the use of yellow glass bulbs which soften
the light. At the Electrical Exhibition, Vienna,
there is a model theatre with numerous scenic
effects never before attempted by gas; and moonlight,
sunrise, sunset, twilight, and night are
all imitated with great fidelity. In the drama
of <i>Love and Money</i> at the Adelphi Theatre,
a flood of daylight bursting in upon some
entombed miners through a hole cut in the coal
by a rescuing party was very well imitated by a
beam of ‘arc’ light. The practice of wearing tiny
star lamps on the hair or dress has also come
more into fashion. Probably the first use of
it was by the fairies in the comic opera of
<i>Iolanthe</i> at the Savoy Theatre. Each fairy carried
a small accumulator on her back half concealed
by her wings, and this gave electricity to a
miniature Swan lamp mounted on her forehead.
Ladies are sometimes to be seen with miniature
lamps attached to their dresses, and lighted by
a touch of their fingers upon a small key hid
in their belts. One might have glowworm or
firefly ornaments at this rate. The ‘death’s-head’
pin worn by gentlemen in Paris a year or two
ago was a similar application of the electric
current. On touching a key to complete the
electric circuit of a small pocket battery, the
eyes of the death’s-head in the wearer’s breast
began to shine like sparks of fire.</p>

<p>The use of the electric light for sporting
purposes has had some curious developments.
Polo, cricket, base ball, skating, and so on, have
all been played by night. At the Montreal Ice
Carnival last winter, the huge ice palace was
illuminated both out and in with thousands of
electric lights, and skating, curling, snow-shoeing,
and toboganning went on by night as well as
day.</p>

<p>Gnats are fascinated by a powerful electric
lamp, and dance about it as they do in a beam
of evening sunshine. Light has an attraction for
many animals besides insects. Flying-fish spring
out of the sea when sailors hang a lantern by the
ship’s side; and in California now it is the
custom to submerge a cluster of Edison lamps
from the bows of a boat with a net expanded
below. When the fish gather round the light
the net is closed on them, and after being hauled
out of the water they are put into water-tanks,
and sent alive on special cars by overland rail to
New York and the Eastern States. The French
<i>chasseur</i> also makes a bag sometimes by employing
an electric light to attract his feathered game;
pigeons especially being lured by it.</p>

<p>Owing to its power, the arc-light is very well
suited for signalling purposes; and hence it is
now used with the heliograph to signal the
approach of cyclones between the British island
of Mauritius and Reunion in the Indian Ocean.
It has also been proposed to signal by transparent
balloons lit by incandescence lamps. The
balloon is raised to a good height by a rope which
also carries the wires conveying the current to
the lamps; and flashes according to an understood
code of signals are made by working a
key to interrupt the current, as in the act of
telegraphing.</p>

<p>Diving operations under the sea are greatly
facilitated by the electric light; and a trial was
recently made of a powerful lamp at Marseilles
in lighting up the hull of a sunken ship. The
amber hunters of the Baltic are also using the
light for seeking the fossil gum on the sea-bed,
instead of waiting until the waves cast it on the
shore. Sea-water is remarkably clear, and the
rocks of the seashore are often beautifully covered
with weeds and shells. It is no wonder, then,
that a submarine balloon has been devised by one
Signor Toselli at Nice, for going under water to
examine them. This observatory holds eight
people, and has a glass bottom and an electric
light for illuminating the sea-caves.</p>

<p>The electric light is not free from danger;
but, from not being explosive, it is far from being
as fatal in its effects as gas. There have been
several deaths from electric shock caused by the
very powerful currents of the Brush and Jablochkoff
machines. For instance, a man was killed
instantly on board the late Czar’s yacht <i>Livadia</i>
when crossing the Bay of Biscay. He had accidentally
grasped the bare connections of one of
the electric lamps and received the current through
his breast. Others have been killed by touching
bare wires conveying the current; a man in
Kansas City, United States, met his death quite
recently in repairing some electric light wires
without knowing that the current flowed in them.
Carelessness of some kind was the source of these
misfortunes; but the use of such very deadly
currents is to be deprecated. When the electromotive
force of an electric current exceeds five
hundred volts it becomes dangerous, and hence
it is that the Board of Trade prohibits the use of
more powerful currents for general lighting. The
use of overhead wires, sometimes uninsulated
and never wholly insulated, such as obtains in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">{143}</span>
some parts of the United States, ought also to be
eschewed, and underground cables, safe out of
harm’s way, employed instead. With cables buried
in the earth, we should not have a repetition of
the curious incident which recently happened at
the Luray Cavern in Virginia, where lightning
ran into the cave along the electric light conductors
and destroyed some of the finest stalactites.</p>

<p>The plan of having tall masts with a cluster
of very powerful lights reflected from the height
by mirrors is a very good one, since it obviates
the distribution of wires and lamps. By imitating
the sun, in this way a Californian town is entirely
lighted from one or two masts; and it is satisfactory
to know that the system is being tried at
South Kensington.</p>

<p>The dynamos of electric machines have been
known to explode, or rather burst from the centrifugal
force due to the rapid revolution of the
armature. An accident of this kind recently
caused great alarm in a New York theatre.
Sparks from the red-hot carbons of arc-lamps, or
between wire and wire of the conductors, have
also led to many small fires; but none of any
great consequence. A spark is so feeble a source
of heat that, unlike the spilling of an oil-lamp, it
does not produce a powerful fire, provided the
materials it falls among are not highly inflammable.
On the whole, the danger of fire with
electric lighting, especially incandescence lighting,
has probably been exaggerated. The incandescence
lamp itself is very safe, since if one be
enveloped in light dry muslin and broken, the
muslin is not burnt. In fact, the rush of air
caused by the broken vacuum entirely dissipates
the red-hot filament.</p>

<p>From its injurious aspects we turn now to its
beneficial qualities. The arc-light by its brilliance
is not good for the eyesight when looked at
direct, but there is probably nothing harmful in
the light itself, unless it should be the excess of
violet rays. It is a cool light; and hot lights,
by drying the natural humours of the eye, are
the most prejudicial to the sight. The incandescence
light which is free from excess of violet
rays is also a cool light; and as it neither pollutes
nor burns the air of a chamber, it is the best
light for a student. Small reading-lamps, fitted
with movable arms carrying incandescent bulbs,
are now manufactured for this purpose. Even
with the incandescence lamp, however, it is advisable
not to look at the brilliant filament.</p>

<p>Surgeons and dentists find these little incandescence
lamps of great service in examining the
teeth and mouth. Some are made no larger than
a pea. Others are fitted into silver probes (cooled
by circulating water) for insertion into the stomach
to illuminate its coats, or enable a physician to
diagnose other internal organs. Dr Payne, of
Newcastle-on-Tyne, recently made an examination
of the liver by inserting one of these
endoscopes into it through an incision made in
the abdomen. M. Trouvé has also fitted a small
lamp to a belt which goes round the physician’s
forehead, thereby enabling him to direct the light
to where he is looking. Another experimenter has
so applied the light that he has been able to
photograph the vocal chords while in the act of
singing; and a third has illuminated the whole
interior of a living fish, so that all the main
physiological operations could be witnessed by a
class of students. Such services as these could
not be rendered by any other known illuminator.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HUSH-MONEY">HUSH-MONEY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> of the countless variety of evil-doers who
thrive upon the misfortunes of their fellow-creatures,
and are enabled to gain a means of
livelihood by the folly and timidity of their dupes,
one class above all others seem to conduct their
depredations with much success, on account of
the defenceless position of the unhappy individuals
upon whom they prey. We allude to those who
make it their business to levy what is termed
‘hush-money.’</p>

<p>There are innumerable miscreants who thrive
upon the possession of some discreditable secret
or family skeleton, which throws a desolating
blight over many a life, to all appearance
surrounded by every comfort and luxury
wealth can command. Scoundrels of this description,
secure in the helplessness of their victims,
pursue with impunity their merciless system
of extortion, being well aware that the terror
of exposure is so great, that silence will be
purchased at any price. If persons who are
threatened by ruffians of this kind with exposure
of some private matter, were once and for all to
refuse to pay one penny for the silence of these
extortioners, how much misery would be avoided!
Each instalment of hush-money only serves to
whet the appetites of these social harpies. It is
infinitely preferable to face boldly at first the
worst, no matter of how serious a nature, than to
supply blackmail for the purchase of what
can never be security. The majority of malefactors
are cowards at heart, although a craven
nature is in such cases concealed often by bluster
and braggadocio. It therefore becomes all the
more important at once to withstand their
infamous importunities.</p>

<p>The ordinary observer, while reading in some
sensational novel the evil deeds and extortion
perpetrated by the class of knaves who subsist
on hush-money, would be inclined to attribute
them to romance. It is, however, well known
to those who have had experience in criminal
matters, that the novelist’s fertile imagination
pales before stern reality. Innocent persons have
been threatened with an accusation of some infamous
crime, and at the same time money has been
demanded as the price of silence. The dread
caused by even an accusation of such a nature
has often, unfortunately, induced persons so situated
to accede to extortionate demands. There
are plenty of <i>mauvais sujets</i> hovering about society
who make it their business to become intimate
with the private history of those upon whose
infirmities they intend to trade. Not many
years since, a notable instance of this occurred.
A gentleman in a high social position was ruthlessly
assailed and socially ruined by a miscreant,
who traded upon the possession of some information
of a dubious nature reflecting discredit upon
his wife. For a lengthened period this gentleman
had paid considerable sums of money for the
silence of his persecutor; at last, however, driven
to desperation by continual and increased demands
for hush-money, he preferred rather to face a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">{144}</span>
public trial than continue longer subject to such
tyranny and extortion.</p>

<p>The following apt illustration of blackmailing,
which came under the writer’s personal cognisance,
will show the rascality in vogue amongst these
wretches. A wealthy merchant was for some
years completely in the power of a thorough-paced
scoundrel who had previously been in his
employ. This knave became acquainted with a
delicate family matter, which, if disclosed, could
but entail shame and misery upon his late
employer. He threatened to make this information
public unless well paid for his silence.
This gentleman, although surrounded by every
luxury, was in truth a thoroughly miserable man.
Living in a constant state of fear lest his family
skeleton should be revealed in all its hideousness,
he continued from time to time to supply his
tormentor with large sums of money. The
continual mental strain caused his health to
give way, until at last he wisely determined
to consult his legal adviser upon what was the
bane of his life. Prompt steps were then taken,
which for ever freed him from further extortion.
These things daily happen, and yet, unfortunately,
frequently remain unpunished.</p>

<p>What can be more terrible than to exist in
constant fear of pending ruin&mdash;entirely at the
mercy of some miscreant, who by one word can
destroy a hitherto stainless reputation! It is a true
saying that ‘there is a skeleton in every house,’
and if discovered by any designing knave, may
be transformed into a sword of Damocles. Confidential
servants and discharged valets often
wring large sums from their former employers
by means of extortionate demands combined with
threats of disclosing certain family matters calculated
to bring shame upon their late masters’ or
mistresses’ good name.</p>

<p>The payment of any illicit demand as a price
of secrecy rarely, if ever, permanently obtains the
object in view, the donor being more or less in
constant fear lest a disclosure should take place.
This usually transpires sooner or later, when the
torturer has abstracted the uttermost penny from
his victim. No greater delusion can possibly
exist than that ‘hush-money’ will secure durable
secrecy.</p>

<p>Happily, however, the legislature, having in
view the nefarious practices of such criminals, has
provided a most potent remedy against this class of
robbers, which remedy cannot be too generally
known. The Act of Parliament 24 and 25 Vict.
s. 49, enacts, <i>That whosoever shall accuse or threaten
any person with a view to extort money or valuable
security, shall be guilty of felony, and be liable
at the discretion of the court to be kept in penal
servitude for life, or for any term not less than
five years</i>. All demands for hush-money met
at the outset by firm and unyielding refusal, is
the best and only course to adopt. In the
majority of instances, a villain would at once be
completely checkmated; and even should he
venture to extremities, the law is powerful enough
to put an end to his shameful trade. Anything
is better than to live in constant terror of exposure,
and to be remorselessly plundered by such a
vampire. We often hear of strange suicides, the
reason for which is wholly incomprehensible. It
is by no means surprising that, at times, persons
wanting in resolution, are made desperate by a
system of exquisite mental torture, when unmercifully
applied by these extortioners. Innumerable
unhappy persons are unquestionably thus tormented,
like Prometheus on his rock. Such
anguish, although unseen, is far greater than
physical suffering, as all mental tribulation is
more severe than mere bodily pain.</p>

<p>If any one who is assailed by a miscreant in
quest of ‘hush-money’ were at once to place the
matter in the hands of some respectable solicitor, a
course of misery would be avoided, as any attempt
to extort money through threats or otherwise
comes clearly within the provisions of the Act
above mentioned; and criminal proceedings will
be found the most effectual means for exterminating
so great a social pest.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
